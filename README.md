For each custom radio, add this line in `fxmanifest.lua`:

```lua
supersede_radio "[ORIGINAL_RADIO_NAME]" { url = "[RADIO URL]", volume = 0.5, name = "[NEW RADIO NAME]" }

```

You can find the list of original radio names in [`data.js`](radio/data.js) and a full example in [`fxmanifest.lua`](radio/fxmanifest.lua).

## Tips üí°

Stream a modified `hud.ytd` file to replace radio logos. This file is also used for the weapon icons, of which you can replace to if you wish to.

Use OpenIV or Codewalker RPF Explorer, search for hud.ytd, export the textures and replace them.

Create a stream folder within this resource and place modified hud.ytd within.
